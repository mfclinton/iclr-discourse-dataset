V0,"b'To my knowledge , this paper is probably the first one to apply few - shot learning concept into high - level computer vision tasks .'",,,B0,b'Thank you for the review and your enthusiasm for applying few - shot learning to richer visual tasks like segmentation !',Thanking,
V1,"b""In this paper 's sense , segmentation .""",,,B1,b'We provide a few clarifications and address the questions listed in your review .',Summary (intro),
V2,"b'It proposes a general framework to few from the very few sample , extract a latent representation z , and apply it to do segmentation on a query .'",,,B2,"b'Given our response here , we would appreciate it if you could comment further regarding'",follow up question,
V3,"b'Cases of semantic , interactive and video segmentation are applied .'",,,B3,,,
V4,b'Experiments are very thorough .',,,B4,,,
V5,,,,B5,b'- novelty with respect to the one existing few - shot segmentation method we cite',follow up question,
V6,,,,B6,,,
V7,b'We see too many variants of few - shot learning papers on mini-imagenet or omniglot .',,,B7,b'- clarity of our figure summarizing interactive segmentation and the other segmentation tasks we address ( Figure 2 )',follow up question,
V8,"b'For the reason of applying to high - level segmentation , the paper already deserves an acceptance for the first work .'",,,B8,,,
V9,b'I believe this work would inspire many follow - ups in related domain ( especially for high - level vision tasks )',,,B9,,,
V10,,,,B10,b'We agree that few - shot learning need not be limited to image classification and should address higher - level tasks such as different types of segmentation as we show in this work .',Agreeing,NEW
V11,,,,B11,b'We hope that our work inspires more progress on few - shot learning for structured output tasks for which labels are even more costly and scarce than image - level supervision .',Planning,NEW

V14,,,,B14,"b'Our work is not the first to consider few - shot learning for structured output , but we do significantly generalize the problem scope and extend the approach .'",,
V15,b'- what is interactive segmentation ?',,,B15,b'Shaban et al. ( 2017 ) consider one - shot semantic segmentation .',,
V16,"b'I looked through the related work , it just mentioned some previous work without defining or describing it .'",,,B16,"b'We consider a wider range of tasks ( instance , semantic , and video object segmentation ) , experiment with varying shot and way ( from one - shot to 1000 + shot and 2 - 20 way ) beyond the prior 1 - 5 shot and fixed 2 - way of Shaban et al. , and propose a novel late fusion architecture ( that is faster to update during inference ) .'",,

V20,b'is there any constraint on z?',,,B20,,,
V21,b'Like Gaussian distributions like what z is like in VAE models .',,,B21,,,
V22,,,,B22,"b'Interactive segmentation is the task of inferring dense segmentation masks from sparse pixel - wise labels within the same image ( see middle panel of Figure 2 and our references Kass et al. 1998 , Boykov and Jolly 2001 , and Xu et al. 2016 ) .'",Answer Elaboration,
V23,,,,B23,b'Guided segmentation is our extension to interactive segmentation that can propagate pixel labels across images and not just within images .',Answer Elaboration,
V24,,,,B24,b'Guided segmentation is necessary to ( 1 ) cumulatively incorporate labels across inputs to keep improving the segmentation and ( 2 ) increase data efficiency by not requiring annotations on every input .',Answer Elaboration,
