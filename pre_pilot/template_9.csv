V0,b'The work concerns convolution in the unit sphere .',,,B0,b'Thank you for the insightful comments .',,
V1,b'It differentiates itself from previously mentioned work by working in the volume space and not the surface space .',,,B1,b'Please find our answers below .',,
V2,"b""While I ca n't say I understand all of the implications of the work , I was left with several questions .""",,,B2,,,
V3,b'Many of these questions are in regards to claims made by the authors whose answer or reference was not made clear .',,,B3,,,
V4,,,,B4,"b'Q1 - The representation of a 3D function defined inside a cube is less convenient for extracting rotation invariants , compared to a sphere and a ball .'",,
V5,,,,B5,"b'For example Cantarkis [ 1 ] showed that the a set of complete basis functions defined inside a unit ball can be formed as Z = R ( x ) Y ( \\theta , \\phi ) .'",,
V6,b'-',,,B6,b'Which means the linear and angular representations can be decomposed and analyzed efficiently .',,
V7,"b'It was not made clear why there is a benefit to convolving the object in the unit sphere vs the unit cube , especially given that the work was not able to perform better than other work that was based on the unit sphere .'",,,B7,b'Achieving rotational equivariance depends only on the angular part while the translational equivariance depends only in the linear part .',,
V8,b'This point was the stated problem of the paper .',,,B8,"b'While we do not achieve translational equivariance in this work due to inherent limitations of the linear component of the Zernike polynomials , it might be possible to achieve this task with a suitable linear component .'",,
V9,"b""Although it was mentioned that the unit sphere preserves all of the points of the object , it is n't clear if the transformation causes any deformations of the object .""",,,B9,,,
V10,"b'Furthermore , the fixing of one axis seems to be a way to hack around problems of increased dimensionality , but there was no justification given .'",,,B10,,,
V11,,,,B11,"b'We have shown in table 2 that our volumetric convolution layer produce richer features compared to closely related spherical convolution methods , which operates on the surface of the sphere .'",,
V12,,,,B12,"b'In fact , the volumetric convolution layer achieves a significant 13.7 % gain over spherical convolution layer .'",,
V13,b'- How does the number of trainable layers help to differentiate resource usage .',,,B13,"b'Convolving in B^3 provides critical advantages compared to other work which work on S^2 : 1 ) Since spherical harmonics are defined on the surface of the unit sphere , projection of a 3D shape function into spherical harmonics approximates the object to a polar shape , which can cause critical loss of information for non- polar 3D shapes .'",,
V14,"b""Would n't a better measure be number of parameters ?""",,,B14,b'This is a common case in realistic scenarios .',,
V15,"b'The authors make that claim that shallowness is a virtue , but there is little discussion as to the size of each layer in comparable terms .'",,,B15,"b'2 ) In spherical convolution , the integration happens over the surface of the sphere , which cannot capture patterns across radius .'",,
V16,,,,B16,,,
V17,,,,B17,,,
V18,"b'- Why was no "" ablation "" or "" accuracy vs trained layers "" data shown for the Modelnet40 dataset ?'",,,B18,b'The deformations depends on the order of moments used .',,
V19,b'I would think that would be stronger evidence than for the Modelnet10 data .',,,B19,"b'For example , the transformation can be considered as a low pass filter , where higher the order of moments , sharper the subtle variations and details of the original object would be represented in the spectral domain .'",,
V20,,,,B20,b'We have derived a novel technique to reduce the distance between the perfect shape representation and practical representation ( please see section 4.1 ) .',,
V21,,,,B21,"b'We have practically evaluated and presented the effectiveness of our technique by calculating the reconstruction error in Figure 5 and Figure 6 , where we achieve a very low reconstruction error of 0.0467 % , which means the deformation can be neglected .'",,
V22,b'-',,,B22,,,
V23,"b""Why was n't the 1d conv net used for creating the viewing angles included in the size of the architecture ?""",,,B23,,,
V24,b'Was there a verification as to what the filters from this network were actually giving ?',,,B24,b'Q2 - We agree that number of parameters would be a valuable comparison across architectures .',,
V25,"b'The authors mention how we should interpret them , but not enough information about the structure of the network is given to satisfy this question .'",,,B25,b'We would add this discussion after investigating the number of parameters in competing methods .',,
V26,,,,B26,b'Thank you .',,
V27,,,,B27,,,
V28,b'- I would have liked to see a description of the types of features that are found by these networks .',,,B28,,,
V29,,,,B29,"b'Q3 - The "" accuracy vs trained layers "" data is illustrated in table 1 .'",,
V30,,,,B30,b'We have added a graphical illustration only for ModelNet10 .',,
V31,b'-',,,B31,b'We will replace it with ModelNet40 data .',,
V32,"b'The authors say they are only going to show experiments on one possible use case , but then make claims for other use cases .'",,,B32,,,
V33,"b'I am referencing that since the texture data in the datasets used is constant , there was no need to model the texture data .'",,,B33,,,
V34,"b'There is no experimental evidence to show this is the case , however .'",,,B34,b'Q4 - We accept it is a mistake by us to not to include the 1 - D convnet to the size of the architecture .',,
V35,,,,B35,b'We have corrected it in the revised version .',,
V36,,,,B36,b'We did not interpret the outputs of the 1 - D convnet as it was not the main focus of the paper .',,
V37,"b'Overall , I think the paper would have been stronger if it had more experiments .'",,,B37,,,
V38,,,,B38,,,
,,,,B39,"b'Q5 - Analyzing functions in B^3 is vital not only for 3D object analysis but in other areas such as function analysis and quantum optics / wavelet analysis ( [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] ) .'",,
,,,,B40,"b'Therefore , we did not limit our discussion to 3D object recognition , although we experiment only on one use case .'",,
,,,,B41,"b'Please consider that this paper is mainly a theoretical paper , where we do the practical implementation as a fully differentiable technique , so it can be integrated into any system that is trained via back - propagation .'",,
,,,,B42,,,
,,,,B43,,,
,,,,B44,"b'Since the lack of 3D object datasets which have texture , we add a simple surface function to the available datasets ( equation 17 ) .'",,
,,,,B45,"b'In cases such as wavelet analysis , the ability to model texture is highly important as the intensity if the points play a key role .'",,
,,,,B46,b'Note that this task cannot be achieved by existing techniques in literature which operates on S^2.',,
