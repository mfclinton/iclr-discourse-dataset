V0,b'Summary',,,B0,b'Thank you for the review and the attention to our architecture and results .',,
V1,,,,B1,"b'Here we detail how our architectural choices lead to key differences from prior work , clarify the metric in our experiments , and discuss the interpretation of our experiments .'",,
V2,"b'This paper proposes to formulate diverse segmentation problems as a guided segmentation , whose task is defined by the guiding annotations .'",,,B2,"b'We would appreciate if the reviewer can comment on how these points affect their views on the novelty , strength of results , and interpretation of our work and reconsider their rating .'",,
V3,,,,B3,,,
V4,b'The main idea of this paper is using meta-learning to train a single neural network performing guidance segmentation .',,,B4,,,
V5,,,,B5,b'>',,
V6,"b'Specifically , they encode S annotated support image into a task representation and use it to perform binary segmentation .'",,,B6,"b'the only differences with the referenced paper ( Shaban et al. , 2017 ) is how the support is fused and how multiple guidance could be handled , which can be done by averaging .'",,
V7,,,,B7,,,
V8,"b""By performing episodic optimisation , the model 's guidance to segmentation output is defined by the task distribution .""",,,B8,,,
V9,,,,B9,"b'Our work differs in architecture , optimization , and scope .'",,
V10,,,,B10,,,
V11,b'Strength',,,B11,,,
V12,,,,B12,"b'For architecture , we factorize the approach into ( 1 ) extracting the task representation and ( 2 ) guiding inference by the representation : this takes the form of our novel late fusion architecture in contrast to the early fusion of Shaban et al .'",,
V13,b'Learning a single segmentation algorithm to solve various segmentation problem is an interesting problem that worth exploring .',,,B13,"b'While this difference might appear minor , it has several important consequences .'",,
V14,,,,B14,b'Late fusion allows for parameter sharing between guide and inference branches that makes optimization converge sooner .',,
V15,b'This paper tackles this problem and showed results on various segmentation problems .',,,B15,"b'Given new support annotations , inference by our model updates an order of magnitude faster because only the late stage is recomputed , unlike the full recomputation of the net required by early fusion .'",,
V16,,,,B16,"b'For multi-class segmentation , our method only requires a single pass to compute a guide for each class , while Shaban et al .'",,
V17,,,,B17,b'inefficiently require a forward pass per class since their early fusion is only defined for binary tasks .',,
V18,b'Weakness',,,B18,,,
V19,,,,B19,,,
V20,"b'The proposed method , including the architecture and training strategy , is relatively simple and very closely related to existing approach .'",,,B20,"b'For optimization we meta-train on sparse annotations , not dense , and do not require per-branch learning rate tuning ( since our parameters are shared ) .'",,
V21,"b'Especially , the only differences with the referenced paper ( Shaban et al. , 2017 ) is how the support is fused and how multiple guidance could be handled , which can be done by averaging .'",,,B21,"b'For tasks with sparsely labeled supports , we achieve an an accuracy improvement of ~ 50 % relative over Shaban et al .'",,
V22,"b'These differences are relatively minor , so I question the novelty of this paper .'",,,B22,b'for only two points per image ; see Figure 5 ( right ) .',,
V23,,,,B23,,,
V24,,,,B24,,,
V25,b'This paper performs experiments on diverse tasks but the method is compared with relatively weak baselines absolute performance looks bad compared to existing algorithms exploiting prior knowledge for each of the tasks .',,,B25,"b'For scope , we formulate the more general problem of guided segmentation , and we agree with the reviewer that "" learning a single segmentation algorithm to solve various segmentation problem is an interesting problem that worth exploring . ""'",,
V26,,,,B26,b'However Shaban et al . restrict their scope to one - shot semantic segmentation from densely labeled support .',,
V27,"b'For example , the oracle performance in semantic segmentation ( fully supervised method ) is 0.45 IOU in PASCAL VOC dataset , while many existing algorithms could achieve more than 0.8 mean IOU in this dataset .'",,,B27,b'We hope that a unified meta-learning framework for varied types of segmentation leads to further progress on the accuracy of such methods over those that require more specialization .',,
V28,,,,B28,,,
V29,"b'In addition , I question whether foreground / background baseline is reasonable baseline for all these tasks , because a little domain knowledge might already give very strong result on various segmentation tasks .'",,,B29,,,
V30,,,,B30,b'> absolute performance looks bad compared to existing algorithms exploiting prior knowledge for each of the tasks',,
V31,"b'For example , in terms of video segmentation , one trivial baseline might include propagating ground truth labels in the first frame with color and spatial location similarity , which might be already stronger than the foreground / background baseline .'",,,B31,,,
V32,,,,B32,"b'> 0.45 IOU in PASCAL VOC dataset , while many existing algorithms could achieve more than 0.8 mean IOU in this dataset'",,
V33,,,,B33,,,
V34,b'There are some strong arguments that require further justification .',,,B34,,,
V35,,,,B35,"b'Please note that we score all methods with positive IU for consistency across tasks ( section 5 , paragraph 2 ) , which is not equivalent to class - wise mean IU !'",,
V36,"b'- In 4.3 , authors argue that the model is trained with S=1 , but could operate with different ( S , P ) .'",,,B36,"b'We will further highlight and explain our choice of metric in the revision to resolve the commented on confusion , thank you .'",,
V37,,,,B37,,,
V38,"b""However , it 's suspicious whether this would be really true , because it requires generalisation to out - of-distribution examples , which is very difficult machine learning problem .""",,,B38,,,
V39,"b'The performance in Figure 5 ( right ) might support the difficulty of this generalisation , because increasing S does not necessarily increase the performance .'",,,B39,"b'Our reported 0.45 positive IU oracle for few - shot semantic segmentation corresponds to 0.62 mean IU , which is expected for our FCN architecture based on VGG - 16 .'",,
V40,,,,B40,"b'The referred to methods that score more than 0.8 mean IU on PASCAL VOC require outside segmentation data , deeper architectures , longer optimization schedules , aggressive data augmentation , test - time post - processing , and more .'",,
V41,"b'- In 5.3 , this paper investigated whether the model trained with instances could be used for semantic segmentation .'",,,B41,b'These extensions are orthogonal to our scientific question comparing our general meta-learning method with the specialized methods for each of the tasks in a common experimental framework with the same base architecture .',,
V42,"b'I think performing semantic segmentation with model trained for instance segmentation in the same dataset might show reasonable performance , but this might be just because there are many images with single instance in each image and because instance annotations in this dataset are based on semantic classes .'",,,B42,,,
V43,b'So the argument that training with instance segmentation lead to semantic segmentation should be more carefully made .',,,B43,,,
V44,,,,B44,b'>',,
V45,,,,B45,b'I question whether foreground / background baseline is reasonable baseline for all these tasks',,
V46,b'Overall comment',,,B46,,,
V47,,,,B47,,,
V48,b'I believe the method proposed in this paper is rather incremental and analysis is not supporting the main arguments of this paper and strength of the proposed method .',,,B48,b'The foreground - background baseline is surprisingly strong for video because DAVIS clips are biased towards containing one salient object per frame .',,
V49,,,,B49,"b""To reduce the severity of this issue , our work evalutes on DAVIS '17 ( Section 5.1 , Figure 6 ) which includes some multi-object tasks instead of the simpler DAVIS ' 16 .""",,
V50,"b'Especially , simple performance comparison with weak baselines give no clues about the property of the method and advantage of using this method compared to other existing approaches .'",,,B50,,,

,,,,B57,,,
